# Tic Tac Toe
I have decided to recreate the iconic childhood game of tic-tac-toe into a Python terminal game, which will run on Heroku.
Users can try to beat the computer by trying to place 3 of their markers in a row, the board will be shown before any moves are made and after each players makes a move.

## How To Play
My Python terminal version of tic-tac-toe is based on the childhood pen and paper game. You can read more about it on __Add link to wiki page.

The game follows the generic rules or the paper based version.
* The board is drawn out.
* Who goes first is decided.
* The first player makes their move and the board will be shown with their move in place.
* Then the second player will make their move and the board will be shown again.
* Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of 3 or until no one can win.

Those are the basic steps of how a single game of tic-tac-toe works.
