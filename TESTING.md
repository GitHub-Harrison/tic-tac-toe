# Tic Tac Toe Testing
This file was created to store all testing related content this includes any and all bugs found as well as the PEP8 validation.

## Testing
The testing process has been broken into two sections; one section as a user to test that everything a user might want from this project works and the other from a more admin focused side in terms of making sure all functions and features work as intended.

### User Story Testing

### Feature/Function Testing

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
* Passed the code through a PEP8 checker and confirmed there are no problems.
* Tested that my project prevents the user from inputting invalid choices/options.
* Tested the code in my local terminal as well as the Code Institute Heroku terminal.
