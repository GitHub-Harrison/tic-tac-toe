# Tic Tac Toe Testing
This file was created to store all testing related content this includes any and all bugs found as well as the PEP8 validation.

## Testing
The testing process has been broken into two sections; one section as a user to test that everything a user might want from this project works and the other from a more admin focused side in terms of making sure all functions and features work as intended.

### User Story Testing
Testing user stories required me to take a user first approach to the game and think solely about what a user would want to be able to do within this game. Below are the user stories I tested for:

* ### "I want to be greeted by a menu"
![Main Menu](documentation/readme/features/main-menu.png)
* ### "I want to be able to read the rules before playing"
![How to play](documentation/readme/features/how-to-play.png)
* ### "I want to be able to play against a computer player"
![Computer player](documentation/readme/features/computer-player.png)
* ### "I want to be able to see the board after each move"
![Updated board](documentation/readme/features/board-updates.png)
* ### "I want to know more about the game before playing"
![About](documentation/readme/features/about.png)
* ### "I want to be able to play again at the end of a game"
![Play again](documentation/readme/features/play-again.png)
* ### "I don't want a cluttered screen while playing"
![Clear function](documentation/readme/features/clear.png)

### Feature/Function Testing

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
* Passed the code through a PEP8 checker and confirmed there are no problems.
* Tested that my project prevents the user from inputting invalid choices/options.
* Tested the code in my local terminal as well as the Code Institute Heroku terminal.

## Bugs
While coding my project I had come across a few issues/bugs which have all been fixed. I took note of some of these bugs and issues through the GitHub issue tab and have linked them below.

### Solved Bugs
* The first bug I encountered was a [Syntax Error](https://github.com/GitHub-Harrison/tic-tac-toe/issues/1) caused by a capitalised while loop.
* The second bug I came across was a [TypeError](https://github.com/GitHub-Harrison/tic-tac-toe/issues/2) issue where a line of code was missing 1 required positional arguement.
* The final issue I encountered was relating to the [main menu function](https://github.com/GitHub-Harrison/tic-tac-toe/issues/3), which printed multiple errors to the terminal while I attempted to get it working as planned.

### Remaining Bugs
* There are no remaining bugs.

## Validator Testing
* PEP8
    * No errors were returned from [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/checkresult)
